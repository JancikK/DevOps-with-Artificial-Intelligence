# read -p "Enter ...: " VARIABLE
# read - Reads input from the user.
# -p - Prompts the user with a custom message.
# VARIABLE - Stores the user input.

# -f "$FILE" - True if the file exists and is a regular file (not directory, socket, etc.).
# -r "$FILE" -True if the file is readable by the user running the script.
# && - Logical AND operator: both conditions must be true.
# then - Starts the code block that runs if the condition is true

# RESULT=$(grep "$SYMBOL" "$FILE") - Command substitution using $(...) â€“ runs the command and stores the output in RESULT.

# grep - Searches for lines that contain the string in $SYMBOL.
# "...": - Double quotes allow variables and support spaces/special characters.

#if [[ -n "$RESULT" ]]; then - Checks if grep found something.
#-n "$RESULT" - True if the variable is not empty.
# echo "$RESULT" - Prints the actual lines that matched the search word or symbol.
# else ... fi - else: Code to run if the if condition is false.
# fi: Ends the if block.
