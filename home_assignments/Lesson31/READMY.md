### Website Request Tool

This is a simple Python program that:
- Asks the user to enter a website URL
- Sends a GET request to the website
- Saves the response into a CSV file
- Logs results and errors to a log file
- Shows how many lines were written to the CSV

### How to Use

### ðŸ”¹ Without Docker
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the program:
   python website_request_tool.py

### ðŸ”¹ With Docker
1. Build the image:
   make build
2. Run the container:
   docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/app lesson31-app
    ## in the future - can be changed just to simple make run
