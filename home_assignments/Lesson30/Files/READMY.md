How to use third.py

Open PowerShell or WSL.

Navigate to the Files folder where third.py is located.

Place all the .txt files you want to rename in that folder.

Run the script:
python third.py . newnamebash

. -> means the current directory.

newname -> is the prefix you want for the renamed files (e.g. newname_1.txt, newname_2.txt).
